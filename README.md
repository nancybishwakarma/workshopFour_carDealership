# *Interesting Code*

        private ArrayList<Vehicle> inventory;

    public Dealership(String name, String address, String phone) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
        this.phone = phone;
        this.inventory = new ArrayList<>();

    }
This is the most interesting code in this program to me. Inside the constructor, we create a new, empty ArrayList and assigns it to inventory. I had never seen that being done before and it was different than our ususal initialization.
